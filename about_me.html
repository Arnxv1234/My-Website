    <p>
      I was born and raised in Anaheim, CA and now live in Cypress, CA. My home
      country is Bangladesh which is where my parents were born and raised. I
      have one other sibling who is the reason I am a Computer Science major.
      She's shown me a lot of good things that come out of it and she is
      actually a Recruiting Coordinator for Chegg. I'm hoping to one day end up
      in Chegg by her side as a Software Engineer.

      To be honest, Computer Science was never a thought in my mind during
      highschool. I was much more focused on my dream of becoming an NBA player
      (when I knew very well I'd never make it). I played 3 years on the Varsity
      basketball team and was on the starting lineup for 2 of those years. After
      my Junior season I ended up fracturing my wrist which led to me realizing
      I was never really going to make it far with basketball. With that and
      covid beginning I decided to learn about computers which led me to the
      position I am in today.

        A little more about me is that a lot of my money goes to playing golf
        almost everyday.

      But I am still terrible at it.
