        <h2>My name is Arnav Rahman, and this is my 4th year at Cal Poly Pomona and my second year as a computer science major.</h2>
        <h3><b>Get To Know Me:</b></h3>
        <p> 
            I was born and raised in Anaheim, CA and now live in Cypress, CA. My home country is Bangladesh
            which is where my parents were born and raised. I have one other sibling who is the reason 
            I am a Computer Science major. She's shown me a lot of good things that come out of it and she is actually 
            a Recruiting Coordinator for Chegg. I'm hoping to one day end up in Chegg by her side as a Software Engineer.

        <h3>My Time In Highschool:</h3>
        <p>To be honest, Computer Science was never a thought in my mind during highschool.
            I was much more focused on my dream of becoming an NBA player (when I knew very well I'd never make it). I played 3 years on the Varsity basketball team 
            and was on the starting lineup for 2 of those years. Here is a <a href="Images/Basketball.JPG">photo</a> from one of my games. After my Junior
            season I ended up fracturing my wrist which led to me realizing I was never really going to make it far with 
            basketball. With that and covid beginning I decided to learn about computers which led me to the position I am in today.
